# About the Project
- Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JS (Landing Page), ReactJS (Visualizer)
- Visualization of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Merge Sort.
- Algorithms and data structures form one cornerstone of an undergraduate computer science education. A technique for improving instruction in this critical area is to bring Algorithm Visualization into the picture. It brings algorithms to life by graphically representing their various states and animating the transitions between those states.
- The basic objective of an Algorithm visualization is that it explains the different types of program algorithms using visual methods like bar graphs ( in sorting, for example) and it presents a way to imagine how a particular program is actually being executed/implemented, step by step.
