- Visualization of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Merge Sort.
- Algorithms and data structures form one cornerstone of an undergraduate computer science education. A technique for improving instruction in this critical area is to bring Algorithm Visualization into the picture. It brings algorithms to life by graphically representing their various states and animating the transitions between those states.
- There are different ways to put this idea into being:-
Using PyGame Module
Using React Framework
Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
